    "### 1. List and briefly define the possible states that define an instruction execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we encounter that all the possible states that define an instruction execution depend on the specific processor architecture and design, however, the most general and common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch: The processor fetches the instruction from memory and stores it in a temporary location, such as the instruction register.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decode: The processor decodes the instruction to determine the operation it specifies, the data involved, and the addressing mode used to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute: Performs the operation specified by the instruction, such as arithmetic, logic, or data movement operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Access: Processor accesses memory to read or write data involved in the instruction execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write-back: In this state, the processor writes the results of the executed operation back to a register or memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetch Operands: Fetches the operand from memory or reads it in from I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stall: Refers to the need for stall or pause execution due to different factors, such as waiting for data or instructions to be fetched or processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate Address: If the operation involves reference to an operand in memory or available via I/O, the address of the operand is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What types of transfers must a computer’s interconnection structure (e.g., bus) support?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, in a computer's interconnection structure, like bus, it must support various types of transfers, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruction transfers: It refers to the transfer of instructions from memory to the processor for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transfers: It is related to transfers between the processor and memory, between different components and with external devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Address transfers: Transfer of memory addresses from the processor to memory or other components, allowing the processor to access the desired location in memory or interact with other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control transfers:  It refers to transfering control signals between components of the computer, like signals showing the start or end of a transfer, interrupts, and signals indicating the status of the components.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in an specific context this general transfers can be understood as transfers between: Processor to memory, Memory to processor, I/O from or to memory, Processor to I/O, I/O to processor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Consider a hypothetical 32-bit microprocessor having 32-bit instructions composed of two fields: the first byte contains the opcode and the remainder the immediate operand or an operand address.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. What is the maximum directly addressable memory capacity (in bytes)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the immediate operand or operand address field is calculated in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "Op size = instruction size - opcode size\n",
    "Op size = 32 bits - 8 bits\n",
    "Op size = 24 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the microprocessor can directly address a maximum of 2^24 bytes of memory using the operand field.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Discuss the impact on the system speed if the microprocessor bus has:\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the speed of the system is determined by the width of the data bus and address bus. Therefor, having a wider bus directly relates to transfering more data in a single operation. This has a huge impact since if it is more efficiente in can lead to faster data transfer and better system performance. However, the direct impact is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. 32-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus\n",
    "    \n",
    "A 32-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus represents that the microprocessor can address up to 2^32 bytes of memory, but can only transfer 16 bits of data at a time, resulting in slower data transfer and lower system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be understood for example with an address bus that is 32 bits, this address can be transferred to memory at once. However, if the data bus is only 16 bits, it will require 2 bus cycles to fetch the 32-bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. 16-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, with a 16-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus, we encounter that the microprocessor can only address up to 2^16 bytes of memory, and can transfer 16 bits of data at a time. Therefor, this would limit the memory capacity of the system, but if we have an smaller data bus, it may allow for faster data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why instruction and data transfers will take four bus cycles each(two for the address and two for the data). \n",
    "But, if the address bus is 16 bits, it won´t access all the memory and the processor must make two transmissions to send the entire 32-bit address to memory. Also, if the data bus is also 16-bit, the microprocessor must have two bus cycles to fetch the 32-bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. How many bits are needed for the program counter and the instruction register?\n",
    "\n",
    "The program counter is mainly used to keep track of the address of the next instruction to be executed, therefor, it must be able to address the entire memory space. Since the microprocessor can directly address up to 2^24 bytes of memory, the program counter must have at least 24 bits in order to function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hande, the instruction register is used to hold the current instruction being executed, and must be able to hold a complete 32-bit instruction to function properly. Therefore, the instruction register must have at least 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. A microprocessor is clocked at a rate of 5 GHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. How long is a clock cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "The duration of a clock cycle can be calculated by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clock cycle time = 1 / clock rate\n",
    "Clock cycle time = 1 / 5 GHz\n",
    "Clock cycle time = 0.2 ns\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining that the duration of a clock cycle is 0.2 nanoseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. What is the duration of a particular type of machine instruction consisting of three clock cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine instruction consisting of three clock cycles will have a duration of:\n",
    "\n",
    "Duration of instruction = 3 * clock cycle time\n",
    "Duration of instruction = 3 * 0.2 ns\n",
    "Duration of instruction = 0.6 ns\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining that the duration of a three clock cycle is 0.6 nanoseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Suppose you wish to run a program P with $7.5 \\times 10^9$ instructions on a 5 GHz machine with a CPI of 0.8.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. What is the expected CPU time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU time can be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU time = instruction count * CPI / clock rate\n",
    "CPU time = (7.5x10^9) * 0.8 / (5 GHz)\n",
    "CPU time = 1.2 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "Having that the expected CPU time for program P is 1.2 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. When you run P, it takes 3 seconds of wall clock time to complete. What is the percentage of the CPU time P received?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU time can be calculated as mentioned before: \n",
    "\n",
    "CPU time = (7.5x10^9) * 0.8 / (5 GHz)\n",
    "CPU time = 1.2 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "And the percentage of CPU time can be calculated as a ratio of CPU time to wall clock time:\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentage of CPU time = (CPU time / wall clock time) * 100%\n",
    "Percentage of CPU time = (1.2 / 3) * 100%\n",
    "Percentage of CPU time = 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, program P received 40% of the CPU time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. A nonpipelined processor has a clock rate of 2.5 GHz and an average CPI (cycles per instruction) of 4. An upgrade to the processor introduces a five-stage pipeline. However, due to internal pipeline delays, such as latch delay, the clock rate of the new processor has to be reduced to 2 GHz. What is the speedup achieved for a typical program?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve this problem, first we need to calculate the execution time of the program for the non-pipelined processor and the pipelined processor. This, will allow us to compare them and calculate the speedup achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-pipelined processor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle time = 1 / clock rate = 1 / 2.5 GHz = 0.4 ns\n",
    "Execution time = CPI * cycle time = 4 * 0.4 ns = 1.6 ns\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelined processor:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the pipelined processor, we need consider the pipeline stages and the reduced clock rate, ssuming that the pipeline stages are equally distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycle time = 1 / clock rate = 1 / 2 GHz = 0.5 ns\n",
    "Execution time = CPI * cycle time = 1 * 5 * 0.5 ns = 2.5 ns\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "Speedup = Execution time of nonpipelined processor / Execution time of pipelined processor = 1.6 ns / 2.5 ns = 0.64\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining the the speedup achieved by the pipelined processor over the nonpipelined processor is 0.64. Which allows us to conclude that the pipeline is not very effective due to the reduced clock rate and the internal pipeline delays.\n",
